Define the set of valid parentheses sequences as those that can be properly matched, where each opening parenthesis must be followed by a closing parenthesis of the same type. For instance, "(()())" is valid, while "(())" is not since the second "(" has no matching ")". Let \( S_n \) represent the set of all valid parentheses sequences of length \( 2n \). For instance, \( S_1 \) contains two sequences: "()" and "()". Given \( n \), the task is to count the number of valid parentheses sequences in \( S_n \) using dynamic programming. Let \( a_n \) denote the number of valid sequences in \( S_n \). For \( n = 1 \): \[ a_1 = 1 \] For \( n > 1 \), a valid sequence can be obtained by adding a closing parenthesis ')' to a valid sequence of length \( 2k \) (where \( 0 \leq k < n \)) followed by an opening parenthesis '(' which must be matched by another valid sequence of length \( 2(n-k-1) \). Therefore, the recurrence relation is: \[ a_n = \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} a_k \cdot a_{n-k-1} \] **Problem**: Determine the number of valid parentheses sequences \( a_n \) for \( n = 5 \).

In a certain region, the ocean floor shifts slightly due to tectonic activity, causing small waves to form when the tectonic plates shift. These waves, called "tsunami alerts," travel along the ocean floor in a straight line. Suppose a tsunami alert originates at point \( O \) and travels in a straight line towards point \( A \), which is \( 60 \) kilometers away from \( O \). As the wave approaches point \( A \), it encounters a submerged ridge perpendicular to its path, which causes the wave to split into two equal parts.

These transformations are studied because they can help classify patterns in spaces like ${\mathbb R}^7$, which is important in areas like geometry and algebra.

Note that the last two digits of $7^n$ form a cycle. 2. **Determine the Cycle Length:** - The cycle length for the last two digits of $7^n$ is 20. This means every 20th power of 7 has the same last two digits. 3. **Apply Modular Arithmetic:** - Instead of computing $7^{1999}$, compute $7^{1999} \mod 100$. - Use the fact that $7^{20} \equiv 1 \mod 100$ to simplify our calculations. 4. **Find the Corresponding Power Within the Cycle:** - Since the cycle length is 20, compute $1999 \mod 20$. - $1999 \div 20 = 99$ remainder $19$. - Thus, $7^{1999} = 7^{20 \times 99 + 19}$. 5. **Calculate the Last Two Digits:** - Compute $7^{19}$ step by step or use a power of a power rule, which states that $(a^b)^c = a^{bc}$. - Determine the exact last two digits of $7^{19}$ by calculation or by using a suitable computational tool.

Imagine you have a subscription to a journal that allows you to freely access research articles on mathematics. One day, you find an article that mentions a sequence of numbers where each term after the first two is the sum of all preceding terms. This sequence starts with $a_1 = 1$ and $a_2 = 2$. The sequence continues: $$a_3 = a_1 + a_2, \quad a_4 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3, \quad a_5 = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4, \quad \text{and so on}. $$ Calculate the value of $a_6$.

A museum has designed a new exhibit layout with $n$ distinct galleries, each represented as points, and certain pairs of galleries are connected by corridors, represented as lines. The museum management wants to ensure that for any pair of galleries, there is at most one way to visit each gallery from the starting gallery without backtracking (i.e., they aim for a directed acyclic graph). Given that for $n = 5$ galleries, the maximum number of unique corridor arrangements is 15, find the value of $n$ for which the number of unique corridor arrangements is just over 2024.
At a recent math club meeting, the teachers introduced the concept of probability using a scenario similar to one mentioned by Hal Daumé III at a conference. They discussed a game based on a bag containing 4 red balls, 3 blue balls, and 3 green balls. The students were asked to solve the following problem: **Problem Statement:** A ball is drawn at random from the bag. What is the probability that the ball drawn is either red or green? To solve this problem, you need to use the formula for the probability of the union of two events: $$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $$ Where: - \( P(A) \) is the probability of drawing a red ball. - \( P(B) \) is the probability of drawing a green ball. - \( P(A \cap B) \) is the probability of drawing a ball that is both red and green (which is not possible in this scenario). The number of total balls is the sum of all balls: \[ \text{Total balls} = 4 (\text{red}) + 3 (\text{blue}) + 3 (\text{green}) = 10 \] Calculate the probability of drawing a red ball: \[ P(\text{red}) = \frac{4}{10} \] Calculate the probability of drawing a green ball: \[ P(\text{green}) = \frac{3}{10} \] Since it is not possible to draw a ball that is both red and green at the same time, \( P(\text{red} \cap \text{green}) = 0 \). So, using the formula: $$ P(\text{red} \cup \text{green}) = P(\text{red}) + P(\text{green}) - P(\text{red} \cap \text{green}) $$ Calculate the final probability.

You have been given a dataset consisting of abundances of a certain species per night over a period, along with two categorical variables: a treatment variable \( T \) and a partitioning variable \( P \). You have built a mixed-effects regression tree (GLMERTREE) model using the random slope and intercept to analyze the impact of these variables on the abundance. Let the response variable \( Y \) represent the abundances, and let \( T \) and \( P \) be categorical variables taking values in \(\{0, 1\}\). You model the relationship as follows: $$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 T + \beta_2 P + \beta_3 TP + \beta_4 X + u_i + v_j + \epsilon $$ where: - \( \beta_0 \) is the overall intercept. - \( \beta_1 \) is the effect of treatment \( T \). - \( \beta_2 \) is the effect of partitioning \( P \). - \( \beta_3 \) is the interaction effect of \( T \) and \( P \). - \( \beta_4 \) is the slope for a continuous covariate \( X \). - \( u_i \sim N(0, \sigma^2_u) \) is the random intercept for the \( i \)-th node. - \( v_j \sim N(0, \sigma^2_v) \) is the random slope for the \( j \)-th node. - \( \epsilon \sim N(0, \sigma^2) \) is the error term. Using the dataset, you have estimated the coefficients as follows: - \( \hat{\beta}_0 = 3.0 \) - \( \hat{\beta}_1 = -1.5 \) - \( \hat{\beta}_2 = 2.0 \) - \( \hat{\beta}_3 = -0.5 \) - \( \hat{\beta}_4 = 0.3 \) Given \( T = 1 \), \( P = 1 \), and \( X = 2 \), calculate the expected abundance per night. Assume \( u_i = 0.5 \) and \( v_j = 0.2 \).

Lily is learning about series in her math class. Her teacher introduces the concept with a simple example: the geometric series. A geometric series is a series where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a constant ratio. For example, consider the series: $$1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} + \cdots$$ In this series, each term is $\frac{1}{2}$ times the previous term. The teacher tells Lily that this series can be represented mathematically as: $$\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right)^{-1}$$ Using this representation, Lily needs to solve the following problem: **Problem:** Find the sum of the series: $$1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{27} + \cdots$$ **Hint:** This series follows the pattern of a geometric series where each term is $\frac{1}{3}$ times the previous term. Represent the series using the given formula and calculate its sum.

Consider a sequence of transactions involving coins in a compact e-cash system where a user has $k$ coins and can spend them in batches. Suppose the user can execute a single transaction to spend a certain number of coins from the wallet, with the choice of spending denominations $d_1, d_\-$, ..., $d\_m$ (where $d\_1 + d\_2 + ... + d\_m = k$). Let's define a function $S(n)$ that counts the number of ways to partition the integer $n$ using the available denominations $d\_1, d\_2, ..., d\_m$. For example, if $k = 7$ and the denominations allowed are 2 and 3, then $S(7) = 3$ because there are three ways to partition 7 using these denominations: $7 = 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 2 + 2 + 3 + 3$. Given $k = 27$ and the denominations $5$ and $7$, find the value of $S(27)$.

Sensor Placement in a Water Distribution Network A water distribution network (WDN) consists of $100$ locations where sensors can be placed to monitor the water quality. Each sensor's coverage area overlaps with its adjacent locations, and no location can have more than one sensor. The coverage pattern forms a circular shift: if a sensor is placed at location $i$, it covers locations $i$, $i+1$, and $i+2$ (modulo $100$). For example, if a sensor is placed at location $33$, it covers locations $33$, $34$, and $35$; if a sensor is placed at location $99$, it covers locations $99$, $00$, and $01$. The problem is to determine the minimum number of sensors needed to cover all $100$ locations such that each location is within the coverage area of at least one sensor.

In the quantum realm, an electron can exist in a superposition of two distinct paths leading to a screen in a double-slit experiment. Suppose there are two observers, Alice and Bob, who attempt to measure which path the electron takes. However, their measurement devices are not perfect: - **Alice's Device**: If Alice measures, she will definitely detect the path of the electron, but there's a 75% chance she will believe the electron took the "A" path and a 25% chance she will believe it took the "B" path. - **Bob's Device**: Bob's device is less accurate. If Bob measures, there's a 50% chance he will believe the electron took the "A" path and a 50% chance he will believe it took the "B" path. Now, if both Alice and Bob independently try to measure the electron without destroying its wave-like nature, they predict the probability of the electron being detected at different points on the screen based on their flawed devices. If the actual probabilities of the electron being detected at points \( P_A \) and \( P_B \) corresponding to each path are equally likely (50% for each), what is the probability that the two devices will **disagree** on the path of the electron?

For example, if $n = 3$ and $m = 2$, then the scores can range from $1^2 + 1^2 = 2$ to $3^2 + 2^2 = 13$. Thus, $S(3, 2) = 2 + 13 = 15$. Find the value of $S(10, 12)$.

Interactive Dialog Box ## New Problem You are provided an image that is known to be uncompressed but the dimensions are unknown. To find the dimensions, you can use a slider that adjusts the width of the image while the height remains fixed at 1000 pixels. By observing the changes in the image quality while adjusting the width, you can determine at which width the image transitions from smooth to pixelated. Given that the quality of the image degrades smoothly as the width decreases until it reaches a threshold, and knowing the original width is an integer, find the original width of the image if the quality becomes unacceptable at widths less than or equal to 1500 pixels. Formally, let \( f(w) \) represent the quality of the image as a function of width \( w \), which is decreasing and continuous over the interval \( 1500 \geq w > 0 \). Assume \( f(w) = 0 \) when the quality is unacceptable, and \( f(w) \) values closer to 1 indicate higher quality. You are given the following information: 1. \( f(1500) = 1 \) 2. \( f(w) \) decreases by 0.1 for every 100 pixels decrease in width. Calculate the smallest integer width \( w \) for which \( f(w) \leq 0.1 \).

Kerodon, a young mathematician, is exploring the world of $\infty$-categories, a branch of mathematics that extends beyond what most middle school students would learn. However, we can translate some of these concepts into simpler terms for our problem. Imagine you have a library with different sections, each corresponding to an $\infty$-category called $\operatorname{\mathcal{C}}$, $\operatorname{\mathcal{D}}$, etc. There is a special book called "Math Fun" that you want to find. You know from the librarian that the book is in the section labeled $\operatorname{\mathcal{D}}$, and this section is considered the "fiber" or part of a whole. Here's a problem for you: Suppose there are 15 books in the library, and each section ($\operatorname{\mathcal{C}}$, $\operatorname{\mathcal{D}}$, etc.) can have exactly one book. You know that the book "Math Fun" is in the section labeled $\operatorname{\mathcal{D}}$, and it is the only book in that section. If the book "Math Fun" is the "initial object" in the section labeled $\operatorname{\mathcal{D}}$, meaning it's the first and foremost book in that section, how many books are there in total in the library that are not "Math Fun"?
Alice is exploring the fascinating world of supercategories, a concept inspired by advanced mathematics. One day, she comes across a challenge involving the concept of a "simple supercategory". Alice noticed that each level of a simple supercategory follows a specific pattern. For a simple supercategory, the number of families in each level $(n+1)$ is defined by adding a specific number of ETAS axioms to the base level of categories. At the base level, there are no additional axioms (0 ETAS axioms), and this level is considered a category with only one composition law. Here’s Alice’s challenge: Alice was given a sequence of numbers representing the number of families in each level of a simple supercategory starting from the base level (Level 1). The sequence is as follows: $$ 2, 4, 8, 16, \ldots $$ Alice is curious to know how many families are in the Level 7 of this sequence. **Question:** What is the number of families in Level 7 of Alice's supercategory?

Each node \( i \) (for \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, n \)) has a certain fixed capacity \( c_i \) to handle data flow. The total capacity of the network is the sum of the capacities of all the nodes, given by: \[ C = c_1 + c_2 + \cdots + c_n \] The network entity needs to distribute data flows \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \) among these nodes such that each flow \( x_i \) is an integer and \( 0 \leq x_i \leq c_i \).

At a certain moment, they wrote down the following equation representing the change: $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = u(n, t) u(n+1, t) - u(n, t) u(n-1, t) $$ Alex then wrote down the next part of the equation they want to figure out "on the next click", which will actually be written on a different slide: $$ \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = u(n, t) u(n+1, t) - u(n, t) u(n-1, t) $$ To help them understand, let’s say at time \( t = 0 \), \( u(n, 0) = 2 \) for all \( n \). \( u(n+1, 0) \) and \( u(n-1, 0) \) are also 2. **Question:** Using the initial conditions \( u(n, 0) = 2 \), \( u(n+1, 0) = 2 \), and \( u(n-1, 0) = 2 \), what is the value of \( \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} \) at time \( t = 0 \) for \( n = 1 \)?

The pattern consists of two types of tiles: 16 blue tiles and 16 red tiles, arranged such that no two tiles of the same color are adjacent. However, unlike traditional checkerboard patterns, the arrangement of blue and red tiles is unique. Now, suppose you randomly select one of the 16 blue tiles and start counting the number of red tiles adjacent to it (clockwise and counterclockwise).

In an asymmetric heterogeneous information network, suppose we have a set of users $U$ and a set of items $I$. Each user has different interests, and the relationships between users and items are asymmetric. The preference of a user $u \in U$ for an item $i \in I$ is represented by a real number $r_{ui}$. Given the following: - A set of users $U = \{u_1, u_2, \dots, u_n\}$. - A set of items $I = \{i_1, i_2, \dots, i_m\}$. - A preference matrix $R = [r_{ui}]_{n \times m}$, where $r_{ui}$ represents the preference score of user $u$ for item $i$. The task is to predict the preference score $p_{u^*i^*}$ for a new user $u^* \in U$ and a new item $i^* \in I$ based on the available preference scores in $R$. You are to use the following method: 1. **User-Based Similarity Calculation**: Compute the similarity between $u^*$ and each user $u \in U$ using the cosine similarity formula: $$ \text{sim}(u^*, u) = \frac{\sum_{i \in I} (\hat{r}_{u^*i} - \bar{r}_{u^*} )(\hat{r}_{ui} - \bar{r}_u)}{\sqrt{\sum_{i \in I} (\hat{r}_{u^*i} - \bar{r}_{u^*})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i \in I} (\hat{r}_{ui} - \bar{r}_u)^2}} $$ where $\hat{r}_{u^*i}$ and $\hat{r}_{ui}$ are the normalized preference scores, and $\bar{r}_{u^*}$ and $\bar{r}_u$ are the mean scores of $u^*$ and $u$, respectively. 2. **Predicting the Preference Score**: Use the weighted average of the preferences of the $k$ most similar users to predict $p_{u^*i^*}$: $$ \hat{r}_{u^*i^*} = \bar{r}_{u^*} + \sum_{u \in S_{u^*}} \text{sim}(u^*, u) (r_{ui^*} - \bar{r}_u) \bigg/ \sum_{u \in S_{u^*}} |\text{sim}(u^*, u)| $$ where $S_{u^*}$ is the set of the $k$ most similar users to $u^*$. Given the following normalized preference matrix $\hat{R}$ and mean scores for $u^*$ and $i^*$: - $\hat{r}_{u^*i_1} = 0.8$, $\hat{r}_{u^*i_2} = 0.6$, $\hat{r}_{u^*i_3} = 0.7$. - $\bar{r}_{u^*} = 0.7$. - $\bar{r}_{u_1} = 0.5$, $\bar{r}_{u_2} = 0.6$, $\bar{r}_{u_3} = 0.7$. - $\hat{r}_{u_1i^*} = 0.6$, $\hat{r}_{u_2i^*} = 0.7$, $\hat{r}_{u_3i^*} = 0.8$. Calculate $\hat{r}_{u^*i^*}$ assuming $k = 2$ and the following similarities: - $\text{sim}(u^*, u_1) = 0.9$, $\text{sim}(u^*, u_2) = 0.8$, $\text{sim}(u^*, u_3) = 0.7$.

First, each student chooses a number between 1 and 5 for the size of their house (in hundreds of square feet). The bigger the number, the bigger the house. 2. Then, each student chooses a number between 1 and 5 for the number of bedrooms in their house. The bigger the number, the more bedrooms. 3. To find the predicted price of their house, each student multiplies the size number by 10,000 to find the square footage in dollars. 4. Each student adds 50,000 to the square footage price for a basic foundation. 5. For each bedroom, they add an additional 50,000 to their total price. **Example:** - If a student chooses a size of 3 (for 300 sq ft) and a number of bedrooms of 4, their calculations would be: - Square footage price: \(3 \times 10,000 = 30,000\) dollars. - Total cost for foundation: \(30,000 + 50,000 = 80,000\) dollars. - Total cost for bedrooms: \(4 \times 50,000 = 200,000\) dollars. - Total predicted price: \(80,000 + 200,000 = 280,000\) dollars. **Question:** Samantha wants to build a house. She decides that her house should be 400 sq ft with 3 bedrooms. What is the predicted price of Samantha's house according to these rules?

**Understanding Exponential Decay and Boundary Behavior** Some physical systems can be modeled using differential equations. In one such system, a substance is spreading out across a surface but its spread is restricted near the edges, causing a **boundary degeneracy**. This restriction causes the substance to lose its strength (mass) exponentially over time. If the initial mass of the substance is 100 units and it loses 20% of its mass every hour due to the boundary degeneracy, how much mass will be left after 3 hours?

Suppose that a sheet of graphene is formed by selecting every other atom from the graphitic material, such that every other hexagon in the lattice is removed. The resulting structure can be modeled as a planar graph where each vertex represents a carbon atom, and each edge represents a bond between carbon atoms.

Snowmobile Tracks and Contested Suicide A snowmobile traveling along a straight pathway in a snowy field leaves behind distinct tracks. The tracks curve to the right and left with equal frequency. When viewed from above, the tracks form perfect semicircles. To investigate further, an investigator measures the snowmobile's tracks and finds that each complete cycle (two semicircles) covers a distance of 20 meters.

Knowing the snowmobile travels at a constant speed of 10 meters per second, determine the total number of complete cycles (left and right semicircles) the snowmobile completes in 10 minutes.

At a science workshop, a group of middle school students are learning about new particles produced in high-energy collisions. One of the talks explains the production of $W^+ W^-$ pairs, which are pairs of particles called "W bosons." During the discussion, a teacher mentions that each $W^+ W^-$ pair is produced via different sub-processes, some of which involve photons. The teacher gives the students the following problem: Suppose in a particular sub-process of $W^+ W^-$ production, the probability of a $W^+$ being produced is $\frac{3}{5}$ and the probability of a $W^-$ being produced is $\frac{2}{5}$.

Consider a sequence of operations involving two processors $C0$ and $C1$ in a computer system. In each operation, $C0$ writes to a shared variable $A$, and then $C1$ reads from $A$. This process repeats 1000 times. In the Write–invalidate Snoopy cache coherency protocol, after writing, $C0$ sets the $Dirty$ bit to indicate that its cache needs to be updated. When $C1$ reads after $C0$ writes, it checks the $Valid$ bit first. If the $Valid$ bit is set and the address is not $Dirty$, then $C1$ reads from the cache; otherwise, it must read from the main memory, causing a bus usage. Assume that: 1. The $Valid$ bit is set for 90% of the reads by $C1$. 2. When the $Valid$ bit is not set, the $Shared$ bit is also not set, and $A$ is always updated by $C0$ before the next operation. Calculate the number of times the system bus is used by the program across the 1000 operations.
In a new game show, contestants are given the opportunity to pick cards from two boxes, Box A and Box B. Each card in Box A has a probability of $\frac{1}{4}$ of being chosen, and each card in Box B has a probability of $\frac{1}{3}$ of being chosen. The game show claims that if a contestant picks more than one card, the probabilities of choosing each card add up. For example, if a contestant picks one card from Box A and one card from Box B, the probability of choosing a specific card from Box A and a specific card from Box B should be $\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{7}{12}$. The contestant wins a prize if they correctly identify two specific cards: one from Box A and one from Box B. The probabilities of picking each specific card are indeed $\frac{1}{4}$ for Box A and $\frac{1}{3}$ for Box B. If two contestants each pick one card from each box, what is the probability that at least one of the contestants wins the prize?

**Problem:** Stanco, Inc., is a decentralized organization with five divisions. The Electronics Division produces a variety of electronics items, including an XL5 circuit board. The division sells the XL5 circuit board to regular customers for $12.50 each. The circuit boards have a variable production cost of $8.25 each. The Clock Division has asked the Electronics Division to supply it with a large quantity of XL5 circuit boards for only $9 each. The Clock Division, which is operating at only 60% of capacity, will put the circuit boards into a timing device that it will produce and sell to a large oven manufacturer. Stanco wants to determine whether the Clock Division should accept the $9 price. The Clock Division has estimated that for every $1 decrease in the cost of the XL5 circuit board, the profit per timing device increases by $3. The cost of the other parts in the timing device is fixed at $15 per device. If the Electronics Division supplies the Clock Division with the circuit boards at a cost of $9 per board, and the timing devices are sold to oven manufacturers at a price that guarantees a 20% profit over the cost of the timing device, what is the minimum selling price of a timing device that achieves this profit goal?

A scientist is studying the properties of a fictional material called "GravityX." The material has three properties that affect its behavior: the square of the Weyl tensor ($W^2$), the Euler density ($E$), and $\Box R$ (which we will represent as $\Box R$). The scientist notes the following: - The effect of $W^2$ is proportional to a certain coefficient, $c$. - The effect of $E$ is proportional to another coefficient, $a$. - The effect of $\Box R$ is also proportional to $a$, but with an ambiguity that can be represented as $a'$ where $a' = a + k$ for some constant $k$.

In the world of mathematical structures, a "scattered sentence" can have different implications on the number of possible models. Imagine you are organizing a math fair and planning to display model sets. You decide to create a section about scattered and non-scattered sentences. For your display, you plan to create two types of model sets: 1. Scattered Model Set: If a scattered sentence exists, you will have up to $\aleph_1$ (which is the cardinality of the set of all countable ordinal numbers) different model types. 2. Non-Scattered Model Set: If a non-scattered sentence exists, you will have the cardinality of the continuum (which is the cardinality of the real numbers) different model types. Given these definitions: - The cardinality of the set of all countable ordinal numbers, $\aleph_1$, is considered to be "countably infinite but larger than the cardinality of the set of natural numbers." - The cardinality of the real numbers is known to be "uncountably infinite and larger than the cardinality of the set of all countable ordinal numbers." Now, let's say you have 10 boxes to display the model sets.

Artemis Wireless, a cutting-edge technology company, is demonstrating its revolutionary new wireless communication system. One of the key features of this system is its ability to optimize data throughput by efficiently using the available frequency spectrum. The company claims that their system can increase data rates by utilizing a technique called "spectrum stitching," which essentially means merging multiple frequency bands to create a wider continuous bandwidth. Let's consider a simplified model where the data rate \( R \) (in Mbps) is directly proportional to the bandwidth \( B \) (in MHz). The constant of proportionality is \( k \), so we have: \[ R = k \cdot B \] Given that the system can utilize up to 4 frequency bands, each 1 MHz wide, and the total available bandwidth is split equally among the used bands. Artemis claims that by utilizing their spectrum stitching technique, they can theoretically increase the effective bandwidth by 25%. If the system without stitching utilizes a bandwidth of 4 MHz, what is the maximum data rate \( R \) achievable with stitching, given that \( k = 0.5 \) Mbps/MHz?

A circular table has a special rule for adding numbers. When two numbers, \(a\) and \(b\), are next to each other, they combine to form a new number \(c = a \cdot b\). Numbers can be combined only with their immediate neighbors. The process starts with three distinct numbers \(x, y,\) and \(z\) placed at points \(A, B,\) and \(C\) respectively, around the table. After each combination, the product is written down, and the combined numbers are removed. This process repeats until only one number remains. Given \(x = 3\), \(y = 5\), and \(z = 7\), find the final number left on the table.

A colony of honeybees starts with a queen that produces offspring in year $t-2$. This queen, named $Q$, has an average breeding value of $B_{t-2} + S1_{t-2}$. In year $t$, a worker group receives half of its genetic material from $Q$. The other half comes from drones mated with $Q$. Each drone-producing queen in year $t-2$ has an average breeding value of $B_{t-4} + S1_{t-4}$. For a particular year, suppose the breeding value of the queen $Q$ from year $t-2$ is $B_{t-2} + S1_{t-2} = 150$. The breeding value of a drone-producing queen from year $t-4$ is $B_{t-4} + S1_{t-4} = 100$. If the worker group from year $t$ receives genetic contributions from 50 drones, calculate the average breeding value of the genetic material received from the drones. Assume each drone-producing queen has an equal chance of being selected as a drone for the worker group.
**Problem:** In a particular cyclic universe model based on the original ekpyrotic scenario, the energy stored in gravity waves follows the function \( E(p) = Cp^3 \), where \( C \) is a constant and \( p \) is the momentum of the gravity waves. The model also predicts that the energy stored in these gravity waves grows faster than the inflation predicts, which follows the function \( E_{\text{inf}}(p) = Ap^2 \), where \( A \) is another constant. Given that the upper bound on the ratio of the tensor (gravity wave) energy to the scalar (curvature) energy observed by the WMAP is \( 0.55 \), and knowing that the ratio of the energy densities of gravity waves to inflation energy can be expressed as \( \frac{E(p)}{E_{\text{inf}}(p)} = \frac{Cp^3}{Ap^2} \), determine the minimum value of \( \frac{C}{A} \) such that the model's prediction does not exceed the WMAP observed upper bound.

In a quantum computing simulation, a two-qubit system is initialized in the state $|11\rangle$. A CNOT (Controlled-NOT) gate is then applied to this system. In traditional quantum computing notation, the CNOT gate transforms the state $|11\rangle$ into the state $|10\rangle$. However, due to the endianness of the system being used in the simulation, the output appears to be $|01\rangle$. Using concepts from **Algebra** and **Probability**, determine the probability of the system being observed in the state $|01\rangle$. Assume the states $|10\rangle$ and $|11\rangle$ are equally likely to occur in a standard quantum system, and the endianness of the simulation does not influence the probabilities of the states.

A company has $n$ customers and maintains a record of the orders made by each customer. The company uses a segment tree to keep track of the orders for efficiency. A segment tree is a data structure where each node represents a range of values, and operations can be performed efficiently on ranges. Initially, all customers have 0 orders. The company receives records of changes to the number of orders for each customer. Each record specifies a customer and the number of additional orders they make. After processing all records, the company wants to calculate the total number of deliveries over all customers. Formally, let $a_i$ be the number of orders made by the $i$-th customer before any changes, and let $b_i$ be the number of additional orders made by the $i$-th customer after all changes. Define $c_i = a_i + b_i$ as the final number of orders for the $i$-th customer. Given $n$ and $q$ records of changes $(i, b_i)$, compute the total number of deliveries, which is the sum of all $c_i$ for all $i$. ## Example Suppose $n = 3$ and the records are: - $(1, 2)$ - $(3, 1)$ - $(2, 3)$ Initially, $a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 0$. After processing the records: - $c_1 = a_1 + b_1 = 0 + 2 = 2$ - $c_2 = a_2 + b_2 = 0 + 3 = 3$ - $c_3 = a_3 + b_3 = 0 + 1 = 1$ Therefore, the total number of deliveries is $c_1 + c_2 + c_3 = 2 + 3 + 1 = 6$.

In the world of acoustics, special materials called metamaterials can manipulate sound waves in interesting ways. One such property is the ability to reveal symmetries in acoustic fields. Suppose a researcher is experimenting with creating an acoustic metamaterial consisting of a grid of squares, where each square can either reflect or absorb sound waves. The researcher notices a pattern where if a square reflects a wave, the square directly to its right must absorb the wave to maintain symmetry. To understand the pattern better, consider a row of 5 squares numbered from 1 to 5. The symmetry is such that if square number 1 reflects a wave, then the wave should be absorbed by square number 2, reflected by square number 3, absorbed by square number 4, and finally reflected by square number 5. If the first square in the row starts by reflecting a wave, determine the number of possible sequences in which the squares can be set to reflect or absorb a wave such that the wave reaches the last square (square 5) while maintaining the symmetry pattern described.
Atrial arrhythmias are abnormal heart rhythms that can be characterized by complex dynamics. In a study to understand the effective dynamics of these arrhythmias, cardiac electrical activity time series data is analyzed. A dynamic phase-space reconstruction is performed to capture the key parameters of the arrhythmias without imposing a specific model on the empirical signals. Consider a cardiac time series $\{ x(t) \}$ with discrete values at equally spaced times $t_i = i \Delta t$, where $\Delta t$ is the sampling interval. The embedding theorem states that the time series can be mapped to an $m$-dimensional phase space, where $m$ is the least integer that can embed the dynamics of the system.

A signal is transmitted over a noisy channel. The channel introduces errors with a probability of \( p \), where \( 0 < p < 1 \). To protect the signal against errors, a forward error correction (FEC) scheme is used. This scheme encodes the transmitted signal such that any single error introduced by the channel can be corrected. The probability that exactly \( k \) out of \( n \) transmitted bits are erroneous can be modeled by the binomial probability distribution: \[ P(X = k) = \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{n-k} \] where \( X \) is the number of erroneous bits, \( \binom{n}{k} \) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose \( k \) errors out of \( n \) bits, and \( p \) is the probability of an individual bit being erroneous. Suppose that a signal is transmitted and it is known that exactly one error occurred in a block of 5 bits. Given that the probability \( p \) of an individual bit being erroneous is \( \frac{1}{3} \), find the probability that the third bit is the erroneous one.

An inventor decides to use a solar panel to power a low-voltage ventilation system in their house. They have one 60-cell solar panel with the following specifications: - Power: 260Wc (watts-peak capacity) - Voltage: ~30V - Current: ~8.5A The inventor records that the solar panel consistently produces 1400Wh (watt-hours) of energy per day in winter. The ventilation system consumes energy at a constant rate of \(E\) watt-hours per day when operating continuously.

The solar panel generates 1400Wh of energy in 24 hours.

Similarly, let $\mathcal{D}_t = \{(\mathbf{x}_i^t, y_i^t)\}_{i=1}^{n_t}$ be a target dataset with $n_t$ samples from a different but related domain. The goal is to adapt the knowledge learned from the source domain to the target domain by aligning the joint distributions of the source and target data.

A group of students is planning a field trip to visit historical sites. There are 6 sites they want to visit: $A, B, C, D, E$, and $F$. The travel time between each site is shown in the table below in minutes. The students want to start and end their trip at site $A$, visiting the other sites exactly once and return to $A$. Use the "nearest neighbor" method to determine a route that minimizes the total travel time. The nearest neighbor method involves starting at a site, moving to the nearest unvisited site, and continuing until all sites have been visited. Then, return to the starting site. **Travel Time between Sites (in minutes)** $$ \begin{array}{cccccc} & A & B & C & D & F \\ A & - & 30 & 45 & 55 & 40 \\ B & 30 & - & 20 & 35 & 65 \\ C & 45 & 20 & - & 40 & 50 \\ D & 55 & 35 & 40 & - & 55 \\ F & 40 & 65 & 50 & 55 & - \\ \end{array} $$ **What is the total travel time of the route found using the nearest neighbor method?**

Consider a function \( f(x) \) defined for all positive integers \( x \), which performs a "BitLShift" operation on \( x \). Specifically, \( f(x) \) shifts the binary representation of \( x \) to the left by one position and appends a zero at the end. For example, \( f(5) = 20 \) because the binary representation of 5 is \( 101 \), shifting it left once results in \( 1010 \), and converting it back to decimal gives \( 20 \). Define a sequence \( \{a_n\} \) where \( a_1 = 1 \) and for \( n \geq 1 \), \( a_{n+1} = f(a_n) \). Thus, \( a_2 = f(1) \), \( a_3 = f(a_2) \), and so on.

Sarah is studying how changes in the weights of a model can affect its performance. In her model, each weight is associated with a different level of importance for certain features in a dataset. Sarah decides to apply a weight decay technique, which reduces the weights to make the model simpler and less prone to overfitting. Sarah's model has three weights: $w_1$, $w_2$, and $w_3$. The formula she uses to calculate the performance of her model is: $$C = C_0 + \frac{\lambda}{2n} \sum_{i=1}^3 w_i^2$$ where: - $C_0$ is the initial performance of the model, - $\lambda$ is the weight decay parameter, - $n$ is the number of data points in the dataset, - $w_i$ are the weights of the model. Sarah wants to understand how the weights affect the performance of her model.

Lila is studying maps in her math class. Her teacher introduced her to a concept similar to the "topological singular set" mentioned in her advanced math class. The teacher gave her a simplified example to understand the concept. Consider a map $u$ that assigns a vector to each point on a flat surface. For simplicity, let's say the map $u$ moves points either up, down, left, or right by a certain number of units. Here are the rules: - If a point is at $(x, y)$, then $u(x, y)$ moves it to $(x+k, y+l)$, where $k$ and $l$ are integers. Lila discovered that some points become "special" when they follow specific movement rules. For example, if $k = 2$ and $l = 2$, then the point $(1, 1)$ moves to $(3, 3)$. Notice that every point moves in a way that maintains its relative position to the origin $(0, 0)$. Lila wants to find out how many unique "special" points appear on a 3x3 grid if we start from the points $(1,1)$, $(1,2)$, $(1,3)$, $(2,1)$, $(2,2)$, $(2,3)$, $(3,1)$, $(3,2)$, and $(3,3)$ and apply the map $u$ with $k = 1$ and $l = 1$.

Each year, a dairy farm tests the milk production of its cows over a 305-day period. In a study, the farm found that the amount of milk produced can be affected by four factors: Breed ($B$), Lactation Length ($L$), Parity ($P$), and Province ($Pr$). To analyze these factors, the farm uses a statistical model based on Automatic Linear Modeling Technique (ALM). The data for each cow includes the following effects: - Breed: British (B) increases milk yield by 5 units, Continental (C) by 3 units, and Holstein (H) by 8 units. - Lactation Length: Each additional day beyond 305 days decreases milk yield by 2 units. - Parity: First-parity cows (P1) produce 4 more units than multiparous cows (Pm). - Province: Province A has an influence of +3 units, while Province B has none. If a Holstein cow from Province A in the third parity has a lactation length of 310 days, what is her predicted milk yield?

In a fantasy role-playing game, a dragon is summoned onto a square battlefield. The dragon, originally a juvenile form occupying a single square, undergoes a series of transformations that increases its size by a factor of \(2\) each time. Thus, after each transformation, the dragon occupies a square that is twice the size in every dimension (length, width, and height). The battlefield is a grid of \(10 \times 10\) squares. The dragon starts at the bottom-left corner of the grid. Each transformation (except the last), the dragon moves straight up one row. After reaching the top row, it moves to the next column to the left and starts the process again. Define a "successful transformation" as one where the dragon's next move would place it entirely within the grid boundaries. Determine the total number of successful transformations the dragon can undergo before it steps outside the grid.

Consider a network of three nodes connected in a ring where each node can communicate with its two immediate neighbors. A sensor observes a linear time-invariant signal and sends its measurements to its neighbors every minute. Due to network delays and packet dropouts, each node maintains an estimate of the observed signal based on local measurements and communicated data. Let \( x_i(k) \) represent the true value of the observed signal at node \( i \) at time \( k \), and \( y_i(k) \) represent the measurement made by node \( i \) at time \( k \). The estimation update at each node \( i \) uses a weighted average of the measurements from itself and its neighbors, as follows: \[ \hat{x}_i(k+1) = \alpha y_i(k) + \frac{1 - \alpha}{2} \left( y_{i-1}(k) + y_{i+1}(k) \right) \] where \( \alpha \) is a constant between 0 and 1, and \( \hat{x}_i(k+1) \) is the estimate of \( x_i(k+1) \) made at node \( i \) at time \( k+1 \). If all nodes start with the same initial measurement \( y_i(0) = 1 \) for all \( i \), and there are no delays or packet dropouts, find the estimate \( \hat{x}_1(2) \) at node 1 at time \( k=2 \) given \( \alpha = \frac{1}{2} \).

A company sells three types of fertilizers: \(F_1\), \(F_2\), and \(F_3\). Each type contains different blends of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (N, P, K). The company uses a scoring system based on the ratio of these elements to ensure optimal growth for plants. The scores for each fertilizer type are calculated as follows: - \(F_1\): The score is the sum of the squares of the numbers of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium atoms. - \(F_2\): The score is the product of the number of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium atoms. - \(F_3\): The score is the maximum number of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium atoms. For a particular batch, the atomic counts for \(F_1\) are \(N = 3\), \(P = 4\), and \(K = 5\). For \(F_2\), the counts are \(N = 2\), \(P = 3\), and \(K = 7\).

Start with the number \(5\). 1. First, it is doubled: \(5 \times 2 = 10\). 2. Then, \(3\) is subtracted: \(10 - 3 = 7\). 3. Next, the result is halved: \(\frac{7}{2} = 3.5\). 4. Finally, \(2\) is added: \(3.5 + 2 = 5.5\). Now, imagine we have a sequence of numbers going through the same transformations. We will apply these transformations to the numbers \(1\), \(2\), \(3\), \(4\), and \(5\). ### Transformation Step: - Double the number. - Subtract \(1\). - Divide by \(2\). - Add \(1\). Calculate each number through the sequence of transformations and find the final result for each number. Then, find the average of these final results.

In a WDM network, bandwidth can be shared among multiple requests. If each request uses at most $1/C$ of the bandwidth of the wavelength, then the grooming factor is $C$. This means that on a given edge of the network, up to $C$ requests can share the same wavelength. Suppose in a network, the grooming factor is $C = 4$. This means up to 4 requests can share the same wavelength. If there are 16 requests that need to be routed through the network, how many wavelengths are required if each wavelength is used according to the grooming factor?

In a study of transport in physics, you are given a quasi-one-dimensional corrugated waveguide that has different degrees of roughness. When the corrugation is complex (rough), the average conductance $\langle T \rangle$ is greater than 1, indicating diffusive transport. As the corrugation becomes smoother, $\langle T \rangle$ decreases and can be close to or even less than 1, indicating localized or even chaotic transport. Suppose a particular corrugated waveguide has an average conductance $\langle T \rangle$ that changes with the smoothness of the corrugation. Initially, $\langle T \rangle$ is measured as 1.2 when the corrugation is fairly complex. After smoothening, $\langle T \rangle$ decreases to 0.8. If the smoothness of the corrugation is changed to make $\langle T \rangle$ decrease by 0.4, calculate the new value of $\langle T \rangle$.

A team of researchers is developing a chatbot that uses natural language processing techniques to understand and respond to user queries. The chatbot makes decisions through a reinforcement learning process, where actions taken by the bot are evaluated based on rewards given by the users. Let's define a simple scenario to explore the application of reinforcement learning in this chatbot: 1. The chatbot has two possible responses, \( R_1 \) and \( R_2 \), to a user query. 2.

Consider a group of high school students organizing a science fair. They decide to create a model inspired by the "planted clique" problem to predict the success of their projects. They define a "project clique" as a group of students who work together closely, indicated by a higher-than-average number of collaborative projects between them. Let \( n \) represent the total number of students in the fair. Each student can be connected to each other student with a probability of \(\frac{1}{2}\), representing a random chance of collaboration. However, to make their model more realistic, they add the assumption that if there is a "project clique" of size \( k \), it increases the probability of collaboration between some pairs to 1. Assume \( k = \sqrt[4]{n} \). The students want to determine the probability that a randomly selected student belongs to this "project clique". They consider the Erdős-Rényi random graph model \( G(n, \frac{1}{2}) \) for the baseline, where no clique is planted, and \( G_k(n, \frac{1}{2}) \), where a clique of size \( k \) is planted. **Problem Statement:** 1. The students are aware that distinguishing \( G(n, \frac{1}{2}) \) from \( G_k(n, \frac{1}{2}) \) is conjectured to be hard for \( k = n^{\frac{1}{2} - \delta} \) when \( \delta > 0 \) is an absolute constant, and they assume \( k = n^{\frac{1}{4}} \). Explain why this distinction matters to their prediction model. 2. Given this setup, calculate the probability that a randomly selected student belongs to the "project clique" of size \( k \). Assume \( n = 16 \).

A golf club manufacturer produces drivers with various combinations of shaft lengths, lofts, grips, and club head materials. They have the following options: - Shaft lengths: 4 different types - Loft angles: 3 different degrees - Grips: 2 different types - Club head materials: 2 different types Each driver is uniquely identified by the combination of these features. The manufacturer wants to analyze the total number of different custom driver combinations they can offer. Due to a recent product change, they have the ability to create drivers where each feature can vary independently of the others, but they also need to accommodate some standard models where not all features are customizable. Assume that in the standard models: - Shaft length and loft angle are always fixed to certain combinations - The number of different combinations of shaft length and loft angle that can be offered in standard models is half of the total possible combinations of these two features. Calculate the total number of different driver combinations the manufacturer can offer including both customizable and standard models.

A team of scientists is studying the unusual behavior of electrons in a topological material called ${\text{WP}}_{2}$. They discovered that the material can be modeled as having a unique lattice structure, where each lattice point interacts with electrons in a specific, predictable manner. Consider a 2D lattice where each point on the lattice either interacts with an electron strongly (represented by $1$) or weakly (represented by $0$). The interaction pattern follows a repeating pattern represented by a finite sequence: $s = (1, 0, 1, 1, 0)$.

Specifically, they sum the sequence $s$ across $n$ cycles, where each cycle is the sequence $s$ itself. Define the function $S(n)$ as the sum of the sequence $s$ across $n$ cycles.

A trader is analyzing the behavior of a stock price over a fixed interval $[0, T]$. The stock price, $P(t)$, as a function of time $t \in [0, T]$, follows a deterministic pattern but can be influenced by two strategies: a market order or a limit order. - **Market Order:** The trader buys the stock at the current market price at time $t = 0$ and sells it at time $t = T$. The profit, in dollars, from this transaction is given by: $$ \text{Profit}_{M} = P(T) - P(0) $$ - **Limit Order:** The trader places a limit order to buy the stock at a fixed price $L$ (where $L > P(0)$), ensuring the trade happens at time $t = T$. The profit, in dollars, from this transaction is: $$ \text{Profit}_{L} = P(T) - L $$ Given that $P(T) = P(0) + 0.05T^2$ and $L = P(0) + 0.02T$, determine the difference in profits between using a market order versus a limit order when $T = 5$ hours.

The question is: How many ways can you divide the 12 items in the first bundle into groups of 2 items each so that each group in the first bundle can be paired with a group in the second bundle of 18 items?

Feynman's Flying Saucer Revisited As inspired by Richard Feynman's observation, consider a spinning plate with a medallion attached to its edge. The medallion has a radius of \( R \) and the plate has a total radius of \( 2R \). The medallion spins around the center of the plate at a rate of \( \omega \) and the plate itself wobbles at an angular velocity \( \omega_w \). When the angle of wobbling is slight, it is observed that the medallion's rotation around the plate’s center is actually twice as fast as the wobbling rate, i.e., the ratio of the medallion's angular velocity to the plate's wobbling angular velocity is \( 2:1 \). Given that the medallion's motion is affected by the Coriolis force due to the wobbling of the plate, calculate the ratio \( \frac{\omega}{\omega_w} \) under the assumption that the Coriolis force keeps the medallion's rotation exactly synchronized with the plate's wobbling such that the ratio is indeed \( 2:1 \).

Expected Number of Bounces in a Game of Bouncy Balls In a classroom activity, students play a game involving bouncing bouncy balls between two points $A$ and $B$ on a straight line. The distance between $A$ and $B$ is $100$ units. Each bounce reduces the distance covered by a factor of $r$, where $0 < r < 1$. The game of bouncy balls has a unique rule: after the $n$th bounce, the ball stops bouncing entirely. That is, the distance covered by the ball after the $n$th bounce is $0$. Every bounce occurs in such a way that after each successive bounce, the ball covers $r$ times the distance it covered in the previous bounce.

Alice and Bob are doing a science experiment with polarized light. They use special filters to measure the light's polarization. Each filter can show one of three results: - If the filter aligns with the light's polarization, Alice's result, \( A \), is 1. - If the filter aligns with the opposite polarization, Alice's result, \( A \), is -1. - If the filter doesn't align with the light, Alice's result, \( A \), is 0.

A mathematician designs a unique investment scheme that involves two currencies, Token (T) and Stoken (sT). Initially, 1 sT is equivalent to 1 T. The investment scheme involves depositing T into a staking contract, which results in receiving the same amount of sT. However, due to a smart contract bug, the amount of sT outstanding exceeds the amount of T deposited. The imbalance is corrected by rebalancing the contract periodically. At each rebalance, sT is burned (destroyed) proportional to the imbalance ratio between T deposited and sT outstanding. Specifically, if \( d \) T is deposited, and the total sT outstanding is \( s \), then \( s \) is rebased to \( d \) after burning an amount proportional to \( \frac{s - d}{s} \times s \). Suppose 100 T are deposited into the staking contract at the start. Over time, due to increased deposits, the total sT outstanding becomes 120. Calculate the amount of sT that must be burned to rebase the contract back to parity (1 sT = 1 T).

During a science fair, two students, Alice and Bob, are working on a project involving the simulation of particle interactions. They use a simplified model that involves adding together different types of exchange to predict outcomes. Similar to the concept of summing up different types of exchanges in physics, Alice and Bob create a math challenge for their classmates. They define a game where each player starts with a score of 0. They roll a six-sided die three times. Each roll represents a type of "exchange" in their game. The possible outcomes of the die roll are labeled as $\pi$, $\eta$, ${\mathbb P}$, $f_2$, $a_2$, and $\gamma$. To determine the points for each roll, they use the following rules: - Roll a $\pi$ or $\eta$ scores 1 point. - Roll a ${\mathbb P}$ scores 2 points. - Roll an $f_2$ scores 3 points. - Roll an $a_2$ scores 4 points. - Roll a $\gamma$ scores 0 points. After each player rolls the die three times, their total score is the sum of the points from all three rolls. **Question**: If Alice rolls the die to get the outcomes $\pi$, ${\mathbb P}$, and $f_2$ in any order, what is her total score?

She represents the evolutionary history of these species in two phylogenetic trees, \(\mathcal{T}_1\) and \(\mathcal{T}_2\), using split notation. The splits are the branching events in the evolutionary trees. The biologist defines a similarity score based on the shared phylogenetic information between the splits in the two trees using the following rules: 1. **Compatible Splits:** If two splits are compatible (i.e., they can both occur without contradicting each other), the similarity score for each pair is the minimum of their branch lengths. 2. **Incompatible Splits:** If two splits are incompatible, the similarity score is 0. The biologist finds the following splits and their respective branch lengths in her trees: - In \(\mathcal{T}_1\), the splits are \(s_1: \{A\} | B\) with branch length 4, and \(s_2: \{AB\} | \phi\) with branch length 3. - In \(\mathcal{T}_2\), the splits are \(s_3: \{A\} | B\) with branch length 5, and \(s_4: \{AB\} | \phi\) with branch length 2.

Emma is playing a Loopy puzzle game where she needs to connect dots using lines. In one puzzle, she started with a grid of 9 dots arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns. She noticed that each dot is connected to its immediate neighbor (up, down, left, right) by a line, and some dots are also connected diagonally. There are numbers next to some of the lines, indicating how many lines should be included in her loop. Emma decided to start her loop from the top-left dot and follow these rules: 1. Move right to the second dot and take 1 line. 2. Move diagonally to the right and down to the third dot and take 2 lines. 3. Move horizontally to the right to the fourth dot and take 1 line. 4. Move diagonally to the left and down to the fifth dot and take 2 lines. 5. Move horizontally to the left to the sixth dot and take 1 line. 6. Move diagonally to the left and up to the fifth dot and take 2 lines. 7. Move horizontally to the left to the fourth dot and take 1 line. 8. Move diagonally to the right and up to the third dot and take 2 lines. 9. Move horizontally to the right to the second dot and take 1 line. 10. Move diagonally to the right and down back to the starting dot and take 2 lines. If each line represents 1 point, how many points did Emma score by completing her loop?
A galaxy consists of $n$ stars, each assigned a unique integer position from $1$ to $n$. A star at position $i$ is called a **fast-growing star** if $i$ divides the sum of all positions, and a **slow-growing star** otherwise. For example, in a galaxy with $n=6$ stars, if the sum of all positions is $21$, then stars at positions $1$, $3$, $6$ are fast-growing stars, and stars at positions $2$, $4$, $5$ are slow-growing stars. Given that the sum of all positions in a galaxy is $120$, find the number of possible values of $n$ such that there are more fast-growing stars than slow-growing stars.

Consider an isosceles triangle \( \triangle ABC \) with \( AB = AC \) and \( \angle BAC = 20^\circ \). Let \( D \) be a point on \( AC \) such that \( \angle DBC = 60^\circ \). Determine the number of degrees in \( \angle BDC \).
Consider a sequence of positive integers \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_n\) such that: 1. The sum of the first \(n\) terms is \(S_n\). 2. For each \(k\), where \(1 \leq k \leq n\), the sum of the first \(k\) terms is given by \(S_k = k(k + 1)(k + 2)\). Determine the value of \(a_{10}\).
A scientist is studying the combustion of sulfur-containing compounds in a closed system. Given the following standard heats of formation (ΔH°f) at 25°C: - CS2(g): 87.8 kJ/mol - H2O(l): -285.8 kJ/mol - CO2(g): -393.5 kJ/mol - H2S(g): -20.6 kJ/mol Calculate the standard enthalpy of reaction (ΔH°rxn) for the following combustion reaction: \[ \text{CS}_2(g) + 2 \text{H}_2\text{O}(l) \rightarrow \text{CO}_2(g) + 2 \text{H}_2\text{S}(g) \] Use the table to express the standard enthalpy of reaction (ΔH°rxn) to three significant figures and include the appropriate units.
Consider the following sequence of operations on a positive integer \( n \). 1. Start with an integer \( n \). 2. If \( n \) is even, divide it by 2. If \( n \) is odd, subtract 1 from it and then divide by 2. 3. Repeat the previous step until \( n = 1 \). For example, starting with \( n = 20 \): \[ 20 \rightarrow 10 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1 \] Let \( S(n) \) represent the minimum number of steps required to transform \( n \) into 1 following the above sequence of operations. Determine \( S(2024) \).
Let \( ABCD \) be a convex quadrilateral and let \( E, F, G, H \) be the midpoints of sides \( AB, BC, CD, DA \) respectively. Let \( P \) be the intersection point of diagonal \( AC \) and \( Q \) be the intersection point of diagonal \( BD \). Given that the area of quadrilateral \( ABCD \) is 60 square units, find the area of quadrilateral \( EFGH \).
Let \( f : \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \to \{0, 1\} \) be a function. We define the **parity sum** of \( f \) as the sum of the values \( f(x) \) for \( x \) ranging from 1 to 5. For how many such functions \( f \) is the parity sum equal to 2?
**AIME Problem Template** Santa is packing toys into gift boxes arranged in a single row on his sleigh. Each gift box has a width of 10 inches and a length of 20 inches. The sleigh has a fixed width and length but can grow as tall as necessary to fit the boxes. Santa needs to pack 100 boxes such that the total height of the packed boxes is minimized. However, to create a unique challenge, Santa wants to pack the boxes in numerical order of their position on the sleigh, starting with box 1 at the front and proceeding to box 100 at the back. The packing arrangement for box \(i\) (where \(1 \le i \le 100\)) has the following properties: - The height of box \(i\) is \(h_i = 2i - 1\) inches. - Boxes must be packed one after another without any overlap or gap. - The packing arrangement must maintain the numerical order of the boxes. Determine the total height of the packed boxes for the sleigh, considering the constraints above.
Let \( A(x) \) and \( B(x) \) be polynomials with integer coefficients such that: \[ A(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x + 4 \] \[ B(x) = x^2 + 3x + 5 \] Define the polynomial \( C(x) = A(x)^3 - B(x)^2 \). Determine the degree of \( C(x) \).
Let \( G \) be a simple, 3-regular graph with 10 vertices. Suppose that \( G \) cannot be 3-edge-colored. Determine the number of edges in \( G \).
